# Using Library of Shandong University

## 1. Introduction

Shandong University library offers access to multiple databases, including CNKI, Wanfang, VIP, etc. However, the access is limited to the campus network. While the campus network is not available, we can use the WebVPN or other methods to access the databases.

## 2. Searching for papers

The search engine on the website of Shandong University library can be used to search for papers. The search engine is available at [http://www.lib.sdu.edu.cn/](http://www.lib.sdu.edu.cn/). 

## 3. Accessing the databases

The databases can be accessed is listed [here](https://www.lib.sdu.edu.cn/dataBank/digitalresource.html).

In some occasions, the database may not be hard to connect.

Just enter the URL or search the name of the database on public search engines, such as Google, Bing, also works.

The website will recognize the IP address of our institution and allow us to access the database freely.

For instance, we can access Britannica Academic at [http://academic.eb.com/](http://academic.eb.com/).

Below is what the webpage of an example site, a brief introduction of alkyd resin, looks like:

While not at the campus, we can use WebVPN to access the databases. The WebVPN is available at [https://webvpn.sdu.edu.cn/](https://webvpn.sdu.edu.cn/).
