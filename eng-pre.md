# Using Library of Shandong University

## 1. Introduction

Shandong University library offers access to multiple databases, including CNKI, Wanfang, VIP, etc. However, the access is limited to the campus network. While the campus network is not available, we can use the WebVPN or other methods to access the databases.

## 2. Searching for papers

The search engine on the website of Shandong University library can be used to search for papers. The search engine is available at [http://www.lib.sdu.edu.cn/](http://www.lib.sdu.edu.cn/). 

## 3. Accessing the databases

The databases can be accessed is listed [here](https://www.lib.sdu.edu.cn/dataBank/digitalresource.html).

In some occasions, the database may not be hard to connect.

Just enter the URL or search the name of the database on public search engines, such as Google, Bing, also works.

The website will recognize the IP address of our institution and allow us to access the database freely.

For instance, we can access Britannica Academic at [http://academic.eb.com/](http://academic.eb.com/).

Below is what the webpage of an example site, a brief introduction of alkyd resin, looks like:

> **summary**
> This document talks about:

- **Alkyd resin**: A type of **oil-modified polyester** that is used as a **film-forming agent** in some paints and clear coatings. It was developed in the 1920s and was once very popular.
醇酸树脂：一种油改性聚酯，用于某些涂料和清漆中作为成膜剂。它于20世纪20年代开发，曾经非常流行。
- **Polymerization reaction**: The process of making alkyd resin by combining an **alcohol** (such as glycerol) and a **dicarboxylic acid** or its anhydride (such as phthalic anhydride). The reaction can also include an **unsaturated oil** (such as linseed oil) to form a **branched polyester** with fatty-acid side groups.
聚合反应：通过将醇类（如甘油）和二羧酸或其酐（如邻苯二甲酸酐）结合起来制备醇酸树脂的过程。反应还可以包括加入不饱和油（如亚麻籽油）以形成具有脂肪酸侧基的分支聚酯。
- **Drying and cross-linking**: The mechanism of forming a **tack-free film** from alkyd resin by exposing it to **oxygen** from the air. The oil portion of the polyester undergoes a **cross-linking reaction** that makes the film more durable and resistant.
干燥和交联：通过将空气中的氧气暴露给醇酸树脂来形成无粘性膜的机制。聚酯的油部分经历了交联反应，使膜更加耐用和耐磨。
- **Alkyd paint composition**: The ingredients of a typical alkyd paint, such as the **oil-modified polyester**, a **solvent** (such as mineral spirits), **metal naphthenates** (to catalyze the drying reaction), and **pigment** (to provide colour and hide the surface).
醇酸漆配方：典型醇酸漆的成分，如油改性聚酯、溶剂(如矿物灵)、金属萘油盐(用于催化干燥反应)和颜料(提供颜色并遮盖表面)。
- **Oil content and classification**: The different types of alkyd resins based on the amount of **fatty acid** in their composition. A long-oil alkyd contains 60 percent fatty acid, a medium-oil alkyd contains 40–60 percent, and a short-oil alkyd contains less than 40 percent.
油含量和分类: 根据其组成中的脂肪酸含量不同而分为不同类型的醇酸树脂。长油型醇酸树脂含有60%的脂肪酸，中油型含有40-60%，短油型含有少于40%。
- **Environmental regulations and alternatives**: The challenges and solutions for alkyd resins in meeting the restrictions on releasing **volatile organic content** into the atmosphere. Some alkyds can be made **water-reducible** by adding free acid groups to the molecules. Other alternatives are polyesters without natural-oil modifiers, which can be cross-linked by different agents.
环保法规和替代品: 醇酸树脂在满足排放挥发性有机物限制方面面临的挑战和解决方案。一些醇类可以通过向分子中添加自由酸基来制成可水化的。其他替代品是没有天然油改性剂的聚酯，可以通过不同的剂交联。

## 4. Using WebVPN

While not at the campus, we can use WebVPN to access the databases. The WebVPN is available at [https://webvpn.sdu.edu.cn/](https://webvpn.sdu.edu.cn/).
