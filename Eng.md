Material science is a multidisciplinary field that studies the properties, synthesis, processing, and applications of various materials, such as metals, ceramics, polymers, composites, nanomaterials, and biomaterials. There are many important conferences on material science that provide opportunities for researchers, engineers, students, and industry professionals to exchange ideas, present their latest findings, and network with peers.

Some of the best upcoming material science conferences in 2023 are:

- **TMS Annual Meeting & Exhibition**¹: This is one of the largest and most prestigious events for the minerals, metals, and materials community. It will be held on **March 19-22** in **San Diego**, USA. It will feature more than **80 symposia** covering a range of topics such as additive manufacturing, alloy design, corrosion, energy materials, nanomaterials, and more. It will also include plenary lectures, keynote presentations, technical sessions, poster sessions, workshops, and exhibitions.
- **SPIE Photonics West OPTO**²: This is the premier conference for photonics and optoelectronics research and innovation. It will be held on **January 28 - February 2** in **San Francisco**, USA. It will showcase the latest advances in optical materials, devices, systems, and applications. It will also include more than **40 conferences** covering topics such as nanophotonics, biophotonics, silicon photonics, quantum technologies, optical communications, and more. It will also feature plenary talks, invited speakers, oral presentations, poster presentations, courses, and exhibitions.
- **Materials for Sustainable Development Conference**³: This is a new conference that aims to address the challenges and opportunities of developing sustainable materials for various sectors such as energy, environment, health, and transportation. It will be held on **October 16-20** in **Torremolinos**, Spain. It will bring together experts from academia, industry, and government to discuss the latest research and innovations in sustainable materials. It will also include keynote speeches, invited talks, oral presentations, poster presentations, panel discussions, and exhibitions.

These are just some of the many material science conferences that will take place in 2023.

Information on the conference papers for the three events and some highlights:

- For the **TMS Annual Meeting & Exhibition**¹, you can find the papers from the various symposia and sessions in the Springer website. Some of the topics covered include advances in pyrometallurgy, new directions in mineral processing, friction stir welding and processing, superalloy 718 and derivatives, magnesium technology, and more. You can also access the supplemental proceedings that contain additional papers on materials science and engineering.
- For the **SPIE Photonics West OPTO** . The papers will be published in the SPIE Digital Library and indexed by major databases. Some of the topics covered include optoelectronic materials and devices, photonic integration, nanotechnologies in photonics, MOEMS-MEMS in photonics, advanced quantum and optoelectronic applications, semiconductor lasers, LEDs, displays and holography, and more. 
- For the **Materials for Sustainable Development Conference** , you can find the papers from the different sessions in the ChemistryViews website. Some of the topics covered include halide perovskites, organic photovoltaics, solar fuels, nanocrystals and 2D materials, catalysis and electrocatalysis, energy storage, bioelectronics, biobased functional materials, clean energy transition, sustainable chemistry and circularity, expansion of photovoltaics, and sustainable transport. You can also read the preface of the conference proceedings that summarizes the main themes and objectives of the event.
